This is my React Gallery app for project 7 of the TeamTreehouse Full-Stack Javascript techdegree.  I've included all files necessary to run the app, except the config.js file that is discussed below.  I've made a couple small changes to the CSS.  I added a background color to the whole page, and added a border to the search box and button.  I also changed the text color and size for the headline element which shows the topic of the images.



In order to run this app, you will need to request an API key from Flickr's API.  Go to the following link( https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/ ), create an account, and request a non-commercial API.  You will then need to go into the "src" folder, and create a file called "config.js".  Include the following code:

const apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY HERE';
export default apiKey;

Once that is added, you'll need to make sure you have "npm" installed.  Then, go to the terminal, make sure you're in the project folder, and type "npm install" to install the dependencies, and then "npm start" to run the app.  The page should open in your browser, but if not, go to your browser, and go to "http://localhost:3000/". The page should run from there.








This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
